        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My idea started from the left image. I imagined that the universe, 
        where we currently live, could be a part of someone’s brain. If that is the case, we are incredibly small beings in the vastness 
        of the universe. Also, I thought nothing cannot change whatever we do on this tiny planet within someone’s brain’s universe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! We become so powerless. We always work hard such for this campus’s tons of assignments. However, you don't need to be disappointed. 
        As we are small, so even if we take a break from what we are doing right now, the universe remains unchanged.

        <p>
        This is the endless loop video I created to help your understanding of my idea. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In someone’s brain, there is a galaxy, and in the galaxy, 
        there is another human and his brain. How tiny we are!

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, through this website, I wanted to help people find some moments of rest and tranquility for a while.
        </p>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, how can I satisfy the people? To resolve this question, I thought about how I personally relieve stress. 
        It was simple. Watching beautiful landscapes, listening to pleasant sounds, enjoying delicious food, and meditating. 
        Thus, I designed to incorporate these sense-satisfying aspects into the website. 
        This website will help you by satisfying each part of your senses. 
        Hope you feel better when you leave this website.
